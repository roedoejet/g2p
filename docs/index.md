# Welcome to the G2P documentation!

G2P is a tool for doing rule-based conversions for text.

This website has the technical documentation for G2P, but we've also written a [7-part blog series](https://blog.mothertongues.org/g2p-background/) if you want a more thorough introduction to why G2P exists and what you can use it for.
