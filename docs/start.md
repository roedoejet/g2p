# Getting Started

## Overview

### What is G2P?

The initial version of this package was developed by [Patrick Littell](https://github.com/littell) and was developed in order to allow for g2p from community orthographies to IPA and back again in [ReadAlong-Studio](https://github.com/ReadAlongs/Studio). We decided to then pull out the g2p mechanism from [Convertextract](https://github.com/roedoejet/convertextract) which allows transducer relations to be declared in CSV files, and some g2p functionality from ReadAlong-Studio, and merge them into a stand-alone g2p library - here it is!

This website has the technical documentation for G2P, but we've also written a [7-part blog series](https://blog.mothertongues.org/g2p-background/) if you want a more thorough introduction to why G2P exists and what you can use it for.
